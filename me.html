            <p>
                My name is Bruno, I'm 15 years old, I've been interested in the area of programming since I was little, I've always been curious but never had the opportunity to delve deeper into the subject. Looking at this situation now, I think I should have started earlier. I'm a big procrastinator and this bothers me a lot.
            </p>

            I have in mind to delve deeper into systems development. I'm not very interested in web programs, like websites and the like. I'm starting with JavaScript, which controversially I'm applying to the web, but I'm going to put node.js into practice.
